things i should read and brief summaries of what i have

[Resurrecting the sigmoid in deep learning through dynamical isometry: theory and practice](https://arxiv.org/1711.04735)

- Some theory around weight initialisations, etc, and how their impacts propagate and become exagerated through the depth of an NN.

[How to Train Your Resnet series](https://myrtle.ai/how-to-train-your-resnet-5-hyperparameters/)
